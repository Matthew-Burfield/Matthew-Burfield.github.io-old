# About The Giphy Slack Bot

The Giphy Slack bot lets slack users share hilarious GIFs with their team mates from right inside Slack. The demo link directs you to the project slash page with more information and an "Add to Slack" button where you can install the app to your slack team.

# The Project

The exciting thing for me with regard to this project is that it was the first time I'd ever pair programmed a project with another developer. Through the Chingu Cohort I linked up with @chemok78 to build this bot.

Pair programming was a lot of fun, @chemok78 is based in Hong Kong so all our pair programming was done remotely. Mostly we would agree on specific meeting times, and then spend 10-20 minutes inside Slack discussing what we wanted to achieve for the session and what our priorities were. We also took turns "driving".

We started off programming from within Cloud9, and awesome platform that gives you a full development environment in the cloud. Here we were both able to edit the same document, and we both had all the same dependencies/versions of node etc since we were both programming from within the same environment.

The only annoying thing was that when it came time to commit our changes, all of our edits would go through whomever created the Cloud9 environment. Not ideal as we both wanted to retain our individual changes.

We then started using [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) which allowed us to screen share. This let us develop locally on our own machines which I found to be much better. We had a couple of issues with poor connections at times which caused the video to drop off, but overall it was a good experience.

I think @chemok78 and I are both at a similar programming level, although I certainly learnt a lot from programming with him as we both have different styles of programming.

Another benefit I found with pair programming, is that it forced us to explain the code we were writing as we were writing it, which I think lead to better coding.

# Using Node

The Slack Bot was built with a node server, and is currently hosted on Heroku. I was actually really surprised how quickly and easily we were able to spin up a node server and do some basic routing. I remember trying to write an application using a node server a few years ago and everything seems so foreign back then, but now that I have a much better understanding of JavaScript, it all came much easier.

To be fair, we didn't have to do anything too tricky on the server, just some basic routing and a few API calls. But still, it was really satisfying to do so easily without doing much node before.

# Overall

Overall I really enjoyed this project. @chemok78 and I have decided to link up again and build a slightly more advanced bot to help teams handle scheduling meetings. So looking forward to getting that off the ground.
