# About Build A Recipe Box

The Build A Recipe Box lets to add and remove recipes to a list. Your list will be saved so when you re-visit the page later you will still have your list of recipes.

# Project Requirements

1. User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

2. User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

3. User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

4. User Story: I can edit these recipes.

5. User Story: I can delete these recipes.

6. User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

# What Can Be Improved

I'm glad to be done with this project for now. I've been working on it non-stop for weeks. I'll definitely spend more time styling it better if I ever come back to it.

# What I liked About This Project

The Build A Recipe Box is one of my first projects using the React view framework, and definitely the biggest React project I've done so far.

It took me quite a while to get going, and I actually had to stop and go do another beginner tutorial to start to wrap my head around how to create components and what they should look like.

I also used react-bootstrap in this project which helped me style the page really easily, but was another learning curve (albiet a small one).

I'm glad to have gone through this project. It took me a lot longer than I expected, and I probably made it more complex than it needed to be, but I learnt a lot about React. Especially with regard to JSX, components, passing props (especially passing functions as props), and maintaining the apps state in a stateful component.
